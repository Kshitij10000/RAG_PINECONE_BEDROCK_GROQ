## 📖 Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content. This notebook demonstrates how to set up and utilize RAG with Pinecone for efficient vector storage, AWS Bedrock for generating embeddings, and Groq for powerful language modeling.

## 🚀 Features

- **Step-by-Step Tutorial:** Clear instructions to implement RAG using Pinecone, Bedrock, and Groq.
- **Integration with Pinecone:** Efficient vector storage and similarity search.
- **AWS Bedrock Embeddings:** Utilize AWS Bedrock for generating high-quality embeddings.
- **Groq Language Model:** Leverage Groq for advanced language generation capabilities.
- **Interactive Demonstrations:** Hands-on examples to reinforce learning.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine.
- **Jupyter Notebook** installed. You can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
API Keys for:
