## üîß Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your machine.
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python's package installer).
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Version control system)
-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed. You can install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
-   API Keys and Accounts for:
    -   [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/): Sign up for an account and obtain your API key.
    -   [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): An AWS account with AWS Bedrock enabled is required.
    -   [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys): Ensure you have access to the Groq API
-   Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kshitij10000/RAG-Pinecone-Bedrock-Groq.git
    cd RAG-Pinecone-Bedrock-Groq
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended)
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. This file is used to store sensitive information like your API keys and is excluded from version control, it should also be included in your `.gitignore`:
        ```env
        PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
        BEDROCK_API_KEY=your_bedrock_api_key
        GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
        ```
        Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook**
    *   Navigate to `RAG_Pinecone_Bedrock_Groq.ipynb` and open it.
3.  **Follow the Steps**
    *   The notebook contains all of the instructions to follow for setting up Pinecone, generating embeddings with AWS Bedrock, and integrating Groq for language generation.
4.  **Run the Cells**
    *   Execute each cell sequentially to build the RAG pipeline.
